# so_long 102/100 (October 2021)
This is my solution for the so_long project of the core curriculum of 42 school.<br>

## Explanation of the project

This projects goal is to create your own 2D game where you have a map that can have different dimensions and contents.<br>

### Requirements to run the game
Only tested on **macOS Catalina (Version 10.15.7)**.<br>
For all other OS it is not guaranteed to work.<br>
OpenGL and AppKit is required to run it.<br>
If you want to run it on Linux [here](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/getting_started.html#compilation-on-linux) is a tutorial that might help and [here](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) is the required version of miniLibX, this is **not tested** with my so_long.<br>

### Map
A valid map is structured as followed:<br>
- 1 player (`P`)
- at least 1 exit (`E`)
- at least 1 collectible (`C`)`
- is recatangular
- has a solid outside border out of walls (`1`)
- all the empty spaces are filled with `0`
- map has to be `.ber`
- no other characters than:
  * `P`
  * `E`
  * `C`
  * `1`
  * `0`
- i.e. `map1.ber`:
- one new line after the map is valid, if there is anything else, it is not valid

10010000000C1
1000011111001
1P0011E000011
1111111111111
```

<br>

### During the game
The player can only be moved by `WASD`.<br>
The player can not move into walls.<br>
The player can only exit if all collectibles are collected.<br>
The amount of movements is counted and displayed in the terminal.<br>
Every try to move even if it is invalid will be counted as one move.<br>

All the visualization is done with the help of the [MiniLibX library](https://github.com/tblaase/so_long/tree/master/mlx "https://github.com/tblaase/so_long/tree/master/mlx").<br>

## How to run the game

All of the commands should be run in the root of the directory.<br>
- compile with `make all`
- run the game with `./so_long maps/map1.ber`

This is how the game looks for the map1.ber.<br>

This is what will be written in the terminal during the game when you successfully win the game.<br>

This is what will be written in the terminal if you give up by closing the game by pressing `ESC` or clicking the red cross.<br>
